According to McKinsey’s 2016 OFSE Q1 report, the oil and gas industry continues to get pummeled, with revenue declining by approximately 30 percent. In this down market, drone services providers can benefit from a little unconventional and creative thinking on how to win over energy customers.

Here are a few key elements to any good proposal that drone service providers should think about in order to close deals.

### Stand Out From The Crowd By Offering Something Unique
The first rule of thumb is dare to be different. When the market is quiet, sometimes the best and only thing you can do to win over prospective clients is to be different. Think about it.  How do you set yourself apart from the competition?  What unconventional advantage do you provide for potential or existing clients?  Can you differentiate yourself on experience level, high touch service, or the delivery of finished data products, rather than raw video / imagery?

### Know The Market
It’s a saying that rings true time and time again...know your target market. If it’s the oil and gas sector then spend some time understanding what the companies in this particular sector are looking for. There is absolutely no point in marketing a unique service if companies in this sector have no need for it.
Once you have gained a deep understanding and appreciation for the sector then try and fine tune your services so that they address particular needs.  In oil & gas, you should be able to speak to your ability to detect & locate leaks, inspect platform flares, survey pipeline, and monitor gas emissions.

### It’s All About Asset + Payload
There is no shortage of variation among unmanned aircraft, each with tremendous differences in capabilities and design.  At the end of the day, however, the UAS is just a tool.  Your job is to match the right tool to the right job.
The more complicated piece of the equation has to do with gaining familiarity with different sensors.  Making your client happy will come down to collecting the right data - which is a function of using the right payload.  For inspecting flares, pipeline, platforms, and spills, the FLIR A65 is a solid choice.  For gas emissions, however, the FLIR G300A is more appropriate.

### Emphasize Operational Excellence.
Drones and payloads are important.  They can’t be ignored.  But your proposals need to focus on your entire operational workflow - the people, training, equipment, procedures, software, and insurance.  And often times, it’s how these elements come together that dictate your win / loss ratio on energy jobs.
Having the right operational processes in place helps tremendously because there are so many possible friction points that you can encounter on a job site - from data retention, to changing requirements, to airspace conflicts. Having the right systems in place ahead of time make all the difference.  Shameless plug - we help with this!

### Customer satisfaction
Making customer satisfaction a top priority will be what sets you apart from other services providers. Practice humility, exert a certain level of professionalism with customers, and reap the big pay off in the end - repeat work and referrals!  Every happy client experience should be transformed into a case study and added to your arsenal of marketing collateral.  This will allow your drone service business to grow organically within the energy space.
